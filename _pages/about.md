# About me

My name is Titouan Rigaud and I mainly work as an infrastructure Ingeneer at [CASD](https://casd.eu). I also teach some classes as an independant lecturer at [Centrale Supelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). You can find informations on the classes I give in the Teaching section of this website. 

## My professional activity

I mainly assist researchers with questions related to storage of data/computations/technical choices. My goal is to ensure the best work conditions for researchers within the high security framework required to process confidential data. More specifically, I am a member of the [Graph4Health project](https://guillaume-lecue.faculty.essec.edu/graph4health) where I assist on techical decisions and participate in some of parts of the project.

I also work on internal projects - like semi-automated exports controls, which allows faster availability and more secure research results for users. More on that topic in my publications. I develop mainly using Python frameworks.

## Teaching

I started teaching in 2024 under the direction of [Francesca Bugiotti](http://www.bugiotti.it/) at centrale supelec. My topics mainly rely about topics I have studied/work on : 
- Computing security
- Cloud and big data
- High performance computations
- Storage

## Other interests

I like to explore the internet and practice OSINT on my own. I have gathered the resources collected across my journeys in a dedicated blog post. May these resources help you in your own journey or simply amuse you !

I also have a passion for mechanical keyboards and self hosting services.

If you need to contact me, I am mainly available by email. I'm not often on linkedin.
